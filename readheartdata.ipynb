    "Heart disease is a term that refers to a variety of conditions that affect the heart. Common conditions include coronary artery disease and exercise-induced angina. Several factors are associated with heart disease, including high blood pressure, high levels of sodium, cholesterol, sugar, and fats, and increasing age (Dalen et al., 2014). In the US, heart disease is the greatest cause of death for both men and women, claiming one life every 33 seconds. In 2021, 695,000 people died from heart disease (CDC, 2023). Considering these stats, we decided to base our project on a knn classification algorithm that will help us predict the presence of heart disease. \n",
